# Zombie: A Search Game

In the *engine* folder is a set of classes that provide the game mechanic for the Zombie search game.

To run, install the packages in the *requirements.txt* and then run:

```
  python main.py
```

Follow the instructions to play the game. 

The interface is crude and text based - but in *main.py* you can see how to instantiate the game object and what methods you need to call. Note the game loop is composed of two parts, checking if game is over, and then checking if the day or game is over.
